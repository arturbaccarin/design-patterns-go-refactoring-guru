/*
Youâ€™re developing a media player that can switch between different states: "Playing," "Paused," and "Stopped."
Implement the State design pattern in Go to handle these transitions. Create a State interface with methods like Play(),
Pause(), and Stop(). Then, implement concrete states for "Playing," "Paused," and "Stopped"
that change the media player's behavior accordingly. Finally, create a MediaPlayer struct that
maintains the current state and delegates actions to it. Simulate switching states by calling the methods and printing messages for each action.
